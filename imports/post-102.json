    "html": "<p>On a recent podcast the creators of Chrome's V8 JavaScript\nEngine, Lars Bak and Kasper Lund, discussed some of the challenges\nof writing a JavaScript compiler. They cautioned that using\n<span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">with</code></span> or <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">delete</code></span> is \"dog slow\". When\nyou use <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">with</code></span>, V8 has to wait until\nrun time to resolve the scope chain. When you use <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">delete</code></span> V8 has to transform\nyour object from a highly-optimized class structure into a slower\nhash table.</p>\n<p>Lars and Kasper mentioned that <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">with</code></span> and <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">delete</code></span> likely have the same\nspeed implications in other JavaScript engines.</p>\n<p><b>So never use <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">with</code></span> or <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">delete</code></span> in a production\napplication!</b></p>\n<p>AJ O'Neal quotes Douglas Crockford saying that removing\n<span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">with</code></span> from the language would\nspeed things up significantly. It sounds like Douglas Crockford\nunderstands nature of JavaScript when it comes to compilers.</p>\n<p>You can find the podcast on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://javascriptjabber.com/008-jsj-v8-and-dart-with-lars-bak-and-kaspar-lund/\">\nJavaScriptJabber.com</a>. The discussion on <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">with</code></span> and <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">delete</code></span> is about from 13:33\nthrough 16:50.</p>",
