It is hard\nto keep track of conversations when the email title is not related\nto the topic.</li>\n<li>Send a description with your meeting requests. The meeting\npurpose shouldn't be a puzzle.</li>\n<li>Use bullets and lists; avoid long paragraphs.</li>\n<li>When sending three or more files, use a .zip file.</li>\n<li>Add your contact information often. I hate it when I have to\nsearch through all my emails to find the very first time you\nincluded your phone number.</li>\n<li>Avoid weird fonts and colors.</li>\n<li>Use a simple email signature--without an image if\npossible.</li>\n</ol>",
