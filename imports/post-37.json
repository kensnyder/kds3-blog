Google did not invent search or email, but they took those\nto the next level after the markets were quite mature.</div>\n<br/>\n<div>3. Google has amazing experience making OS. They've built very\ncomplex data storage systems to be infinitely scalable and triple\nredundant. Here is a white paper on the file system component of\ntheir storage systems: http://labs.google.com/papers/gfs.html .\nThey must have done some Linux development to get the storage\nsystems so mature. And don't forget about Android.</div>\n<br/>\n<div>4. Google may be targeting netbooks, but look at the larger\npicture. It seems their long-term goal is really cloud computing.\nAs you mention, Google will encourage and develop the cloud\nconcept, but I think they have much bigger plans for cloud\ncomputing. And Netbooks are just a foot in the door--what better\nway to sell storing data off the computer than on a cheap and puny\ncomputer that holds non-professional data and is not designed to be\na long-term computer.</div>\n<br/>\n<div>Google has an amazing long-term vision and I have a feeling\nthat Chrome OS is not an end in itself, but a vehicle to take their\nbusiness models to the next level. Google holds a lot of cards it\nhasn't revealed.</div>",
