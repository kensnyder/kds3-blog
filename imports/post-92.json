The site was\ncreated by Mathias Bynens <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mathiasbynens.be\">(blog)</a> and the benchmarking engine,\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://benchmarkjs.com/\">Benchmark.js</a>,\nwas created by John-David Dalton <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allyoucanleet.com\">(blog)</a>.</p>\n<p>JavaScript is by nature only acurate to 1 millisecond, and some\nbrowsers are acurate to only 15 milliseconds in practice.\nBenchmark.js uses higher resolution timers where available. For\nbrowsers it utilizes a Java Applet to access a high-precision\ntimer. When Chrome or NodeJS are run with a <span class=\"geshifilter\"><code class=\"text geshifilter-text\">--enable-benchmarking</code></span> flag,\nit makes use of a native microsecond timer.</p>\n<p>Benchmark.js takes benchmarking to the next level by using\nstatistical analysis. For example, long-running tests run for more\ntime than short-running tests and the statistical significance\ndisplays right next to the result. John-David Dalton criticizes\nSunspider and other benchmark engines for lack of attention to\nsolid statistics principles.</p>\n<p>Let me illustrate. If your jsPerf.com results show script A is\n500 Operations Per Second ±8%, and script B is 540 Operations Per\nSecond ±8% you can tell that the speeds are about the same. But\ngiven the same number of Operations Per Second and a margin of\nerror of under 1%, you can tell that script B is a bit faster.</p>\n<p>Performance data really becomes powerful when tests are run\nacross many browsers. Just make a jsPerf.com entry, copy the short\nlink, and share it via email or Twitter to get some friends to test\nwith their browsers. jsPerf.com will track and report the progress\nof all tested browsers.</p>\n<p style=\"float:right\" title=\"Click to view a live example on jsPerf.com\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jsperf.com/jsonh#results\"><img src=\"/sites/all/themes/kds2/img/posts/jsperf-example.png\" height=\"212\" width=\"423\" alt=\"screenshot\"/></a></p>\n<p>So the news with jsPerf.com is that results are now displayed in\ngraphical form using the Google Visualization Library. Particularly\nhelpful is the column-style bar graphs that show one set of bars\nper browser.
