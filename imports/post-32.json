    "html": "<p>For 214 calendar days, I was without Internet. The last day\nwithout Internat was May 19, 2009--the next day I started a new\njob. The CEO took all Internet access away \"temporarily\" under the\nguise of security. Until indirectly repremanded, I maintained\nseveral different day tallies at my desk as a silent protest.</p>\n<p>Others' protests included a wall plastered with desk-calendar\npages and a paperclip chain with one paperclip each day. Eventually\nhe converted the paperclip chain to a binary representation when he\nexhausted his paperclip supply. Yes, 214 days requires 8 bits worth\nof paperclips.</p>\n<p>During that time I had little motivation for keeping up with\npersonal coding projects and keeping up with friends after work. I\nnever quite made the connection as to why that motivation left me,\nbut now I realize operating in a disconnected world makes me feel\nout of the loop. Without 9 hours of connection every day, I feel\nlike there is no time to \"catch up\" and make meaningful connections\nin the evening.</p>\n<p>The result was more TV and pathetic longing for connection.</p>\n<p>It is so refreshing to be back!</p>",
