He quotes Jeff Croft:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's already too late. \"HTML5\" has taken on meaning as a\nmarketing term and is being used as such — not least by the browser\nvendors. Any opposition is pointless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the past, HTML4 has been called just \"HTML\". It is important\nto realize that HTML5 isn't completely new, HTML4 has been evolving\ninto HTML5 for years. Here are my responses to some common\nmisconceptions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To do animations, you need plain JavaScript not some new thing\nin HTML5.</li>\n<li>Flash can be used in HTML5. The two are not mutually\nexclusive.</li>\n<li>Canvas does not aim to meet Flash functionality.</li>\n<li>HTML5 is not a synonym for canvas drawing.</li>\n<li>HTML5 is not a synonym for iPad-compatible video.</li>\n<li>The HTML5 standard is not complete, but using features of it\nthat are implemented in a user's browser is NOT \"risky\". Web\ndevelopers should use JavaScript to detect available features and\nfall back to slower or less pretty alternatives when new features\nare not available. See A List Apart's M&amp;M analogy of <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement/\" target=\"_blank\">Progressive Enhancement</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moving past what HTML5 is not, let's discuss <em>what is\nnew</em> in the browser world. Below are some highlights.</p>\n<p>New HTML Elements</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Canvas</strong>—The &lt;canvas> tag that gives\nlow-level access to draw things. Many frameworks are making it easy\nto use the Canvas to make a rich web experience. <a href=\"http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html\" target=\"_blank\">DiveIntoHTML5.org reference</a></li>\n<li><strong>Audio and Video</strong>—Using &lt;video> and\n&lt;audio> tags, developers can embed video and audio and let\nthe browser add it's own controls for play, pause, volume, etc. It\neliminates the need for the Flash Plugin which has higher overhead\nand is not available for all browsers. As of this writing (August\n2010) Safari, Mobile Safari, Chrome support the MP4 (h.264) video\nformat in video tags. <a href=\"http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html\" target=\"_blank\">DiveIntoHTML5.org reference</a></li>\n<li><strong>Form Elements</strong>—New input types such as date,\ncolor, number range, telephone and email allow browsers to provide\na better experience. <a href=\"http://diveintohtml5.org/forms.html\" target=\"_blank\">DiveIntoHTML5.org reference</a></li>\n<li><strong>Semantic Markup</strong>—Tags such as &lt;nav> and\n&lt;figure> give a better way for developers to show intent and\nsearch engines to provide meaningful results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New JavaScript APIs</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>JavaScript Web Sockets</strong>—Web Sockets provide a\nway for servers to service more users at once while significantly\nreducing response times. Instead of a traditional page-by-page web,\nwe deliver content by events triggered by the browser <em>OR</em>\nthe server.</li>\n<li><strong>Server-Side JavaScript</strong>—A Stack Overflow user\ngives a decent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884724/what-is-node-js\">list\nof advantages of NodeJS</a>, the premier Server-Side JavaScript\nengine.</li>\n<li><strong>Web GL</strong>—Bleeding edge browser versions can show\noff hardware-accelerated 3-D canvas operations. Say hello to XBox\n<em>Browser Version</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript Language Additions</strong>—Browsers are\nstarting to implement APIs that allow developers more power with\nthings such as objects and loops. Kangax is tracking <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/\">progress\nof these implementations</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript Parse Speed</strong>—Ever since Chrome came\nto market, browser makers have been pushing the envelope for speed.\nWikipedia talks about this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine#The_JavaScript_engine_race:_2010\" target=\"_blank\">speed race</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript Touch Events</strong>—Events such as\nmouseover and keydown are difficult or impossible to capture on\nsome mobile devices. But touch-capable devices can fire new events\nsuch as touchstart and gesture start. Peter Paul Koch has done some\nextensive research: <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/pp.koch/the-touch-events\" target=\"_blank\">Slideshow</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/02/do_we_need_touc.html\">\nArticle</a></li>\n<li><strong>Browser-side Storage</strong>—Traditionally, desktop\napps had a huge advantage over web: the ability to store data\noffline to provide a better user experience and consume less server\nresources. <a href=\"http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html\" target=\"_blank\">DiveIntoHTML5.org reference</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>New CSS Declarations</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CSS Alternatives to Images</strong>—Gradients, shadows\nand rounded corners can now be done CSS--eliminating the need for\ndownloading such images.</li>\n<li><strong>CSS-Based Animation</strong>—Browsers can run\nanimations quickly and lean on Hardware Acceleration to make\nAnimations easy and smoother and less processor intensive than\nJavaScript animations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are in the post-IE6 era of web development and us developers\nhave a lot to be excited about!</p>\n<p>And test your browser's HTML5 support on <a href=\"http://html5test.com\" target=\"_blank\">html5test.com</a>.</p>",
